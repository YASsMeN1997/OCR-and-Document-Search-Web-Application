# OCR-and-Document-Search-Web-Application
 - The "OCR Web Application with Keyword Search" prototype leverages the advanced capabilities of ColPali, Byaldi, and Huggingface Transformers for Qwen2-VL to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on uploaded images containing both Hindi and English text. This web-based tool, developed using Gradio, offers a user-friendly interface for image upload, text extraction, and keyword search functionalities.

# Key Features:
 - Multilingual OCR: Utilizes the ColPali implementation of the Byaldi library in conjunction with Huggingface Transformers for Qwen2-VL, enabling accurate and efficient text extraction from images in Hindi and English.
 - Keyword Search: Implements a basic search feature that allows users to locate specific keywords within the extracted text.
 - Gradio Interface: Employs Gradio to build an interactive and intuitive web interface for seamless user interaction.
 - Live Deployment: Accessible via a live URL, allowing users to experience the application's capabilities in real-time.
# Technologies Used:
 - Python: Programming language for backend development and model integration.
 - ColPali: Efficient data processing and model training framework.
 - Byaldi Library: Advanced natural language processing library.
 - Huggingface Transformers: Pre-trained models and accelerated development tools.
 - Qwen2-VL: Model specifically designed for visual language processing tasks.
 - Gradio: Frontend framework for building interactive web applications.
# How to Use:
 - Upload an image containing both Hindi and English text to the web application.
 - The ColPali-Byaldi-Huggingface Transformers model processes the image to extract text in both languages.
 - View the extracted text displayed on the interface.
 - Utilize the keyword search functionality to search for specific keywords within the extracted text.
